Availability Requirements Definition
....................................

Telecommunication customers expect their voice and data services to always be
available. System availability is dependent on the availability of individual
components in the system. To help ensure 24/7 service, it must be possible to
perform system maintenance and system expansion on running telecommunication
networks and servers without disrupting the services they implement. Systems
must be able to withstand component failures, making redundancy of components
such as power supplies, fans, network adapters, storage, and storage paths
essential. Software failures can also significantly impact the availability of a
compute node, so robust application software, middleware, and operating system
software is required for single node availability.

Single Node Availability Categories
===================================

This section is a collection of requirements that address the robustness of a
single computing node. Availability is further enhanced by clustering individual
computing nodes so that a node cannot represent a single point of failure. The
single node requirements in the Availability section can be categorized as:

   - On-line operations

   - Redundancy

   - Monitoring

   - Robustness

On-Line Operations
------------------

On-line operations enable the system to continue to provide a service while the
software or the hardware is replaced or upgraded on the system. For instance,
when a file system needs repair, repair procedures may require rebooting the
system. However, CGL requires that it be possible to forcibly un-mount a file
system, allowing repair and remounting without rebooting. The ability to replace
or upgrade hardware such as disks, processors, memory, or even entire
processor/memory blades without bringing down that node or the network
contributes significantly to continuous service availability.

Redundancy
----------

A highly available system must be composed of redundant components and must
be able to take advantage of redundant hardware such that the system continues
to function when a component fails. Ideally, designs can eliminate all single
points of failure from a system. Using redundant communication paths, such as
redundant network ports and host adapters, together with network fail-over
software capabilities, such as Ethernet bonding, improve network availability.
Redundant storage paths, such as redundant fiber channel ports and host
adapters used with multipath I/O, improve storage availability. Redundancy of
memory components may not be possible, but error detection and correction can
be used to mask memory cell failures; CGL requires software Error Correction
Code (ECC) support. Single bit errors are reported when they are detected in the
hardware and logged by the kernel. The kernel invokes a panic routine whenever
uncorrectable multi-bit errors are detected.

Monitoring
----------

Rapid detection of hardware or software failures requires health monitoring.
Health monitoring is also needed to check for hardware or software that is
beginning to fail, such as ECC memory checking, predictive analysis for disks,
and processes that do not respond in a predicted way. Examples of CGL
monitoring requirements include Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Processes and
Memory Over-commit Actions. The Non-Intrusive Monitoring of Processes
requirement detects abnormal behavior by a process, such as process death,
and initiates an action, such as the creation of a new process. The Memory Over-
commit Actions requirement monitors system memory usage and controls
process activity when memory usage exceeds specified thresholds.

Robustness
----------

A highly available system must be composed of redundant components and must
be able to take advantage of redundant hardware such that the system continues
to function when a component fails. Ideally, designs can eliminate all single
points of failure from a system. Using redundant communication paths, such as
redundant network ports and host adapters, together with network fail-over
software capabilities, such as Ethernet bonding, improve network availability.
Redundant storage paths, such as redundant fiber channel ports and host
adapters used with multipath I/O, improve storage availability. Redundancy of
memory components may not be possible, but error detection and correction can
be used to mask memory cell failures; CGL requires software Error Correction
Code (ECC) support. Single bit errors are reported when they are detected in the
hardware and logged by the kernel. The kernel invokes a panic routine whenever
uncorrectable multi-bit errors are detected.

+---------------+-------------------------------------+-------------+----------+
|  CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide the ability to         |
|  control kernel virtual memory allocation adjustments based on the           |
|  specific needs of the system. Control of virtual memory shall include but   |
|  not be limited to the following:                                            |
|                                                                              |
|  - Heuristic overcommit handling. Obvious overcommits of address space are   |
|    refused. Used for a typical system. It ensures a seriously wild           |
|    allocation fails while allowing overcommit to reduce swap usage.  root    |
|    is allowed to allocate slighly more memory in this mode. This is the      |
|    default.                                                                  |
|                                                                              |
|  - Always overcommit. Appropriate for some scientific applications.          |
|                                                                              |
|  - Don't overcommit. The total address space commit for the system is not    |
|    permitted to exceed swap + a configurable percentage (default is 50) of   |
|    physical RAM.  Depending on the percentage you use, in most situations    |
|    this means a process will not be killed while accessing pages but will    |
|    receive errors on memory allocation as appropriate.                       |

|  management capabilities for processes that cannot be altered to             |
|  incorporate a monitoring API. Such capabilities are known as                |
|  non-intrusive monitoring. These capabilities must be implemented            |

|  Another issue for many such processes is that the start script itself may   |

|  happen, and the child process remains under the control of the management   |

+---------------+-------------------------------------+-------------+----------+
| CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a mechanism that        |
| enables a quick application restart. Typical applications in a carrier       |
| environment use multiple processes with inter-process communications. As     |
| applications become more complex, application initialization times become    |
| longer.                                                                      |

| To speed up application initialization, the mechanism shall provide the      |
| functionality to simultaneously save memory images of multiple processes     |
| (including the kernel resources used by each process) and to restore the     |
| images.                                                                      |

| When the application completes initialization, including making              |
| connections between processes and setting up kernel resources for            |
| inter-process communication, the application invokes a save function that    |
| makes a copy of the memory images of the process and kernel resources. If    |
| the application hangs, the mechanism restores the memory images and kernel   |
| resources and restarts the application.                                      |

Clustering Requirements Definition
..................................

The CGL working group conducted a clusters usage model study from which they
learned that no single clustering model meets the needs of all carrier
applications. So CGL takes a more general approach to defining clustering
requirements. CGL defines the functional components of a carrier grade High
Availability Cluster (HAC). The requirements for other cluster models, such as a
scalability cluster, a server consolidation cluster, and a High Performance
Computing (HPC) cluster, have been treated as secondary to requirements for
the HAC cluster model. See Illustration 3.

   Illustration 3: HAC Cluster View

A CGL high availability cluster is characterized by a set of two or more
computing nodes between which an application or workload can migrate depending
on a policy-based failover mechanism. Essentially, the cluster nodes can “cover”
for each other. Carrier grade services must maintain an uptime of 5 nines
(99.999%) or better and, quite often, a failing service must restart in
sub-second time frames to maintain continuous operation.

A loosely coupled cluster model with no shared storage is a basic clustering
technique that is suitable for many types of telecommunications applications
servers. This model eliminates the possibility of a failed shared component
affecting the availability of the service or the availability of system.

Whether shared storage is implied or not, a cluster provides the following
advantages:

   * Prevents a node from being a single point of failure. With hardware faults,
     the failing node can be replaced or repaired without affecting the service
     uptime (no unscheduled downtime)

   * Allows a software or kernel upgrade to be completed on each node separately
     without affecting the availability of the service

   * Isolates failing nodes from the cluster and enables service to continue
     using the remaining healthy nodes

   * Allows hardware upgrades on each node separately without affecting service
     availability

   * Enables increased capacity to meet load/traffic increases

CGL clustering functional requirements include support for redundancy (no single
point of failure), not only at the cluster node level, but at the hardware level
as well, including fans, power supplies, memory ECC, communication paths, and
storage paths. To support continuous operation of carrier grade services,
requirements are defined for node failure detection and various forms of service
failover, such as application, node address, and connections failovers.

The CGL clustering requirements are framed around industry standard programming
interfaces. The Service Availability Forum (SA Forum) has developed an
Application Interface Specification (AIS) that defines service interfaces for
clustered applications. The specification is OS-independent and is being used in
both proprietary and open source cluster developments. The SA Forum AIS
specifies a membership service API, a checkpoint service API, an event service
API, a message service API, and a lock service API. AIS also specify an
availability management framework (AMF) that provides resource management and
application failover policy in the cluster.

CGL Clustering Environment
==========================

As stated previously, we learned from our usage model study that no one
clustering model fits and meets the needs of all carrier applications. We are
not going to create such model. Instead, a more generalized CGL clustering model
is presented in this document that serves to identify the functional need of
each component of a High Availability Cluster environment. This general model is
illustrated in the diagram below, which shows the need for redundancy, stateful
failover, and shared storage in a cluster application. This diagram is *not* a
topology of any specific cluster deployment. It is up to application developers
and system administrators to determine the usage and configuration of their
cluster systems.

The functions shown in Illustration 3 are described below:

   * **1+1 Hot Standby Cluster** is composed of one active primary node and one
     hot standby node and possibly a set of shared storage. It includes
     redundant paths between cluster nodes and to the storage.

   * **Shared Storage** provides a set of mirrored disks (for redundant data)
     and can be achieved with software or hardware.

   * **Redundant Paths** include the multiple communication paths between
     cluster nodes (CCPs) and the multiple paths from a node to access the
     storage (CSPs).

   * **N+M Cluster** is the extension of a 1+1 hot standby cluster. In this
     model, the cluster can be configured with additional hot or cold standby
     nodes as needed by the application. Functional needs of the data check
     pointing capability and the access to the shared storage remain the same.

   * **Data Check Pointing** is part of the cluster services. It constantly
     synchronizes the in-memory states and data of an application allowing the
     cluster to provide stateful failover of the application from one node to
     another node.

   * **Access Shared Storage** – A cluster application stores and retrieves
     application data to and from the redundant shared storage. These data are
     persistent on the mirrored disks.

   * **Service Entry Point Director** routes and directs which cluster node
     shall provide the service to the service requester.

   * **Cluster Management Console** is a node in the system that manages all
     cluster nodes, but is not part of the cluster membership. It provides a
     view of the cluster to an operator. It monitors the hardware status of the
     cluster nodes and monitors cluster events such as cluster node failure. The
     operator can use it to perform some cluster node failure recovery
     functions, such as the re-boot of a cluster node allowing the node to re-
     join the cluster membership.

   * **Users** are the service requesters. A user can be a human being, an
     external device, or another computer system .

End users of carrier grade equipment have prioritized the need for HAC cluster
configurations as:

   * 2-node (active/hot standby) cluster that support
      * Checkpointing of in-memory application states for rapid application
        failover

      * Shared storage access from a single node at a time.

      * Redundant access to shared storage from a single node

      * Redundant inter-node communication paths

   * 2-node (active/active) cluster that support
      * Concurrent access to shared storage.

   * N node (active/active) cluster that support
      * Storage “scalability”

      * Improved service performance in accessing shared storage.

   * N+M node (active/hot or cold standby) cluster that support
      * Extension of active/standby pair.

Rationale for CGL Clustering Requirements
=========================================

The requirements described in this section are intended to be independent of
specific projects, products, or implementations.

The cluster requirements are framed around industry standard application
programming interfaces. For these clustering requirements, the SA Forum
Application Interface Specification will be used. The SA Forum AIS services that
apply to this specification are:

   * SA Cluster Membership Service API (Chapter 6)

   * SA Checkpoint Service API (Chapter 7)

   * SA Event Service API (Chapter 8)

   * SA Message Service API (Chapter 9)

   * SA Lock Service API (Chapter 10)

The Availability Management Framework API (Chapter 5) provides the following
services to SA-aware applications:

   * Registration and un-registration

   * Health monitoring

   * Availability management

   * Protection group management

   * Error reporting

Other requirements are described in this document are not related to cluster
application APIs, but define requirements that are needed in a cluster. These
include items such as shared storage support, synchronized time, and cluster
management functions such as monitoring, control, and diagnostics. Items such as
a clustered file system and clustered volume manager are also included in this
document as they are essential building blocks for HA clustering, although they
have no established APIs.

+---------------+-------------------------------------+-------------+----------+
|  CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a fast,                |
|  communicationbased cluster node failure mechanism that is reflected in a    |
|  cluster membership service. At a minimum, the cluster node failure          |
|  mechanism maintains a list of the nodes that are currently active in the    |
|  cluster. Changes in cluster membership must result in a membership event    |
|  that can be monitored by cluster services, applications, and middleware     |
|  that register to be notified of membership events. Fast node failure        |
|  detection must not depend on a failing node reporting that the node is      |
|  failing. However, self-diagnosis may be leveraged to speed up failure       |
|  detection in the cluster. This requirement does not address the issue of    |
|  how to prevent failing nodes from accessing shared resources (see           |
|  CFH.3.0 Application Fail-Over Enabling).                                    |

|                                                                              |
|  - Support for multiple, redundant communication paths to check the          |
|    health of cluster nodes.                                                  |
|                                                                              |
|  - Support for fast failure detection. The guideline is a maximum of         |
|    250ms for failure detection. Since there is tradeoff between fast         |
|    failure detection and potentially false failures, the                     |
|    health-monitoring interval must be tunable.                               |
|                                                                              |
|  - Ability to provide a cluster-membership change event to middleware and    |
|    applications.                                                             |

|  Cluster node failure detection must use only a small percentage of the      |
|  total cluster communication bandwidth for membership health monitoring.     |
|  The guideline is that the bandwidth used by the health monitoring           |
|  mechanism shall be linear with respect to the number of bytes per second    |
|  per node.                                                                   |

|  CGL specifies that carrier grade Linux shall provide a way to fence a       |
|  failed or errant node from shared resources, such as SAN storage, to        |
|  prevent the failed node from causing damage to shared resources. Since      |
|  the surviving nodes in the cluster will want to failover resources,         |
|  applications, and/or middleware to other surviving nodes in the cluster,    |
|  the cluster must make sure it is safe to do the failover. Killing the       |
|  failed node is the easiest and safest way to protect shared resources       |
|  from a failing node. If a failing node can detect that it is failing,       |
|  the failing node could kill itself (suicide) or disable its ability to      |
|  access shared resources to augment the node isolation process.  However,    |
|  the cluster cannot depend on the failing node to alter the cluster when     |
|  it is failing, so the cluster must be proactive in protecting shared        |
|  resources.                                                                  |

|  Applications and nodes are monitored and a failover mechanism is invoked    |
|  when a failure is detected. Once a failure is detected, the application     |
|  failover mechanism must determine which policies apply to this failover     |
|  scenario and then begin the process to start a standby application or       |
|  initiate the re-spawn of an application within 1 second.                    |

|  *Note*: The full application failover time is dependent upon application    |
|  and node failure detection, the time to apply the failover policies, and    |
|  the time it takes to start or restart the application. The aggregate        |
|  failover time for an application must allow the cluster to maintain         |

Definition of Cluster Terms
===========================

[ ] indicates a term that is defined elsewhere in the definitions of terms.

Application
-----------

A set of [processes], running on a computer [system], that provides a service to
the [users] of this [system]. An application is usually referred to as the non
operating system portion of the software in a [system].

Availability
------------

Availability is the amount of time that a [system] [service] is provided in
relation to the amount of time the [system] [service] is not provided. [System]
[service] downtime could be the result of [system] [failures] (unscheduled
downtime) or for things like upgrades, system relocation, or backups (scheduled
downtime). A [system] [service] is provided if the [service] is functioning at
an acceptable level of [performance] or [scalability].  Availability is commonly
expressed as a percentage (see [five-nines] or [six-nines]).

Percent Availability = (time service is provided / total time) X 100

Cluster
-------

Two or more computer [nodes] in a [system] used as a single computing entity to
provide a [service] or run an [application] for the purpose of [high
availability], [scalability], and distribution of tasks.

Communication
-------------

The exchange of information between [processes]. These [processes] can be
running on the same [node] (intra-node) or on different [nodes] (inter-nodes).
The information includes [events] and [messages].

Data
----

Numerical or other information represented in a form suitable for processing by
a [process].

Data Checkpointing
------------------

The mechanism by which [application] state is transmitted from an active
[service unit] to one or more standby [service units].

Event
-----

A [communication] with or without data which notifies a set of zero or more
[processes] that something took place. This communication can be either within a
[node] and/or between [nodes].

Event Service
-------------

A publish/subscribe event service that manages [events]. [Events] may be grouped
into named channels and handle attributes such as priority, ordering, retention
times, and persistence. A [subscriber] informs the event mechanism that it
wishes to receive a certain event. A [publisher] posts an event to the event
mechanism to be delivered to all [subscribers] of that event. This way the
[publisher] and [subscriber] are decoupled, they do not have to directly know
about each other, just about the event. Events may be asynchronous or
synchronous. A [publisher] posting a synchronous event will block or be informed
when all [subscribers] have received the event. The [publisher] of an
asynchronous event will not block waiting for delivery or be informed when the
event is delivered to any [process].

Failback
--------

The process to migrate back to a [node] after it has been [repaired]. It can be
controlled or automatic.

Failover
--------

The ability to automatically switch a [service] or capability to a [redundant]
[node], [system], or [network] upon the [failure] or abnormal termination of the
currently-active [node], [system], or [network].

Failure
-------

The inability of a [system] or [system] component to perform a required function
within specified limits. A failure may be produced when a [fault] is
encountered. Examples of failures include invalid data being provided, slow
response time, and the inability for a [service] to take a request. Causes of
failure can be hardware, firmware, software, network, or anything else that
interrupts the [service].

Failure Detection
-----------------

A failure is ultimately caused by an unmasked [fault] in the [system]. Failure
detection is the process, usually from external view, to detect a [failure] of
the [service] the [system] is providing.

Fault
-----

An error in a computer [system] or the [service] it provides. A fault may be
masked and not impact the [application] or the [service] it provides. A fault
can also be classified as transient or permanent. A fault is often associated
with a [system] defect in the software or hardware. A fault can be caused by
external stimulus to the [system].

Fault Confinement
-----------------

Equivalent to [fault isolation].

Fault Detection
---------------

Ability to detect an abnormal condition (device failure, temperature error,
etc.) in the [system].

Fault Diagnosis
---------------

The localization of a [fault] to its repair unit.

Fault Isolation
---------------

Ability to protect the rest of the [system] from the effects of a [fault].

Fault Prediction
----------------

Detecting or forecasting [faults].

Fault Tolerance
---------------

Ability for a [system] to mask a set of [failures] from impacting the [service]
it provides.

Five-Nines
----------

Five-nines is measured as 99.999% [service] [availability]. It is equivalent to
5 minutes a year of total planned and unplanned downtime of the [service]
provided by the [system].

Group Multicast
---------------

The sending of a single [message] to a set of destination [processes].

Hand-over
---------

Equivalent to [switch-over].

Lock Service
------------

The lock [service] is a distributed lock [service], suitable for use in a
[cluster], where [processes] in different [nodes] might compete with each other
for access to shared resources. A lock [service] may provide the following
capabilities: exclusive and shared access, synchronous and asynchronous calls,
lock timeout, trylock, deadlock detection, orphan locks, and notification of
waiters.

Message
-------

A [communication] with [data] in a form suitable for transmission. A message may
contain attributes of the [communication] such as source, destination, time
stamps, and authorization information, etc. It may also contain [application]
specific information.

MTTF
----

Mean Time To [Failure]. The interval in time which the [system] can provide
[service] without [failure].

MTTR
----

Mean Time To [Repair]. The interval in time it takes to resume [service] after a
[failure] has been experienced.

Network
-------

A connection of [nodes] which facilitates [communication] among them. Usually,
the connected nodes in a network use a well defined [network protocol] to
communicate with each other.

Network Protocols
-----------------

Rules for determining the format and transmission of data. Examples of network
protocols include TCP/IP, UDP, etc.

High Availability
-----------------

The state of a [system] having a very high ratio of [service] uptime compared to
[service] downtime. Highly available systems are typically rated in terms of
number of nines such as [five-nines] or [six-nines].

Node
----

A single computer unit, in a [network], that runs with one instance of a real or
virtual operating system.

Node Membership
---------------

The mechanism by which computer [nodes] join and leave a cluster as well as the
mechanism to detect [node] [failure]. A [node] is deemed to be a member if it
has joined the [cluster] successfully. A [node] is deemed to be a non-member if
it has not joined the cluster or if it has left the cluster. A detected
[failure] may result in the [node] leaving the cluster or being isolated from
the cluster, depending on node membership policy.

Performance
-----------

The efficiency of a [system] while performing tasks. Performance characteristics
include Performance total throughput of an operation and its impact to a
[system]. The combination of these characteristics determines the total number
of activities that can be accomplished over a given amount of time.

Process
-------

A single instance of a software program running on a single [node].

Process Group
-------------

A collection of processes registered within [cluster] software.

Process Group Membership
------------------------

The mechanism by which [process] registration, un-registration, and [failure
detection] is managed. A [process] is deemed to be a member if it has registered
with the [process group] successfully. A [process] is deemed to be a non-member
if it has not registered with the process group. A [detected] failure may cause
the [process] to become a non- member, depending on the process group membership
policy. A [process] can gracefully un-register to depart from the process group.
The process group membership also handles authorization to join the membership.
Process group membership depends upon [node membership] if process group
membership is available on multiple [nodes].  Process group membership is used
to execute application [failover] policy.

Publisher
---------

A [process] that sends [events].

RAS
---

[Reliability], [availability], and [serviceability]

Recovery
--------

To return a failing component, [node] or [system] to a working state. A failing
component can be a hardware or a software component of a [node] or [network].
Recovery can also be initiated to work around a [fault] that has been detected;
ultimately restoring the [service].

Redundancy
----------

Duplication of hardware, software, or network components in a [system] to avoid
[Single Points of Failure].

Reliability
-----------

The continuation of [service] in the absence of [failure]. Reliability is
commonly measured as the [MTTF] of a [system].

Repair
------

The process to remove a [fault].

Replication
-----------

A component, [node], or [system] which is configured identically to a base
component, [node] or [system] for the purpose of [fault tolerance],
[performance], or ease of [service].

Scalability
-----------

How well a solution to some problem will work when the size of the problem
increases?  In the CGL context, the scalability is defined as the ability of a
[system] to provide the same level of [high availability] performance when the
work load of the [service] increases. The solution to increase the [system] or
[service] scalability can be software or hardware oriented.

Service
-------

A set of functions provided by a computer [system]. Examples of communications
services include media gateway, signal, or soft switch types of applications.
Some general examples of services include web based or database transaction
types of applications.

Service Unit
------------
A collection of one or more software [processes] that provide [service] to a
[user].

Serviceability
--------------

The capability for a [system] to be maintained and updated. Often,
serviceability is measured by how easy a maintenance task can be performed or
how quickly a [system] [fault] can be tracked down and repaired so that the
[system] can resume the [service].

Single Point of Failure
-----------------------

Any component or [communication] path within a computer [system] that would
result in an interruption of the [service] if it failed.

SIX-NINES
---------

Six-nines is measured as 99.9999% [service] [availability]. It is equivalent to
30 seconds a year of total planned and unplanned downtime of the [service]
provided by the [system].

SUBSCRIBER
----------

A [process] that receives [events]. A [subscriber] may subscribe to one or many
[events]. A subscriber may join and leave an event subscription at any time
without involving the publishers.

SWITCH-OVER
-----------

Ability to switch to a [redundant] [node], [system], or [network] upon a normal
termination of the currently-active [node], [system], or [network]. Switch-over
can happen with or without human intervention.

SYSTEM
------

A computer system that consists of one computer [node] or many nodes connected
via a computer network mechanism.

USER
----

An external entity that acquires [service] from a computer [system]. It can be a
human being, an external device, or another computer [system].

Serviceability Requirements Definition
......................................

This section specifies a set of useful and necessary features for servicing and
maintaining a system. Telecommunication systems such as management servers,
signaling servers, and gateways must have the capability to be managed and
monitored remotely, have robust software package management for installations
and upgrades, and have mechanisms for capturing and analyzing failure
information. A single point of control is required for applications, software,
hardware, and data for functions such as data movement, security, backup, and
recovery.

CGL systems will support remote management standards such as Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP), Common Information Model (CIM), and Web-Based
Enterprise Management (WBEM). Local management standards include IPMI and the
Service Availability Forum's Hardware Platform Interface (HPI).

Debuggers, application and kernel dumpers, watchdog triggers, and error analysis
tools are needed to debug and isolate failures in a system. Diagnostic
monitoring of temperature controls, fans, power supplies, storage media, the
network, CPUs, and memory are needed for quick failure detection and failure
diagnosis.

|  does it preclude such a system. This requirement only necessitates that     |
|  a single device may be upgraded without requiring the administrator to      |
|  be physically at the device. Note: Due to the wide range of platforms       |
|  and applications in use, CGL does not specify a specific downtime limit     |
|  metric. Downtime targets will vary based on the system application.         |

Performance Requirements Definition
...................................

This section is a collection of requirements for the Linux operating system that
describe the performance and scalability requirements of typical communications
systems. Key requirements include a system's ability to meet service deadlines;
to scale in order to take advantage of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP),
simultaneous multithreading (SMT) technology, and large memory systems; and to
provide efficient, low latency communication.

Without predictable execution latencies, it is possible that service deadlines
would not be met, resulting in dropped calls, unreasonable call-response
characteristics, or even dropping the entire service from active operation. Soft
real-time scheduling provides predictable CPU scheduling latencies within
defined loads. Latency and scheduling parameters are required to be configurable
at runtime, including the scheduling quantum being configurable to 1ms or less.
However, the services use many resources other than the CPU; therefore,
protection against priority inversion, priority inheritance to system resources,
and appropriate system resource scheduling are also required to maintain
predictable scheduling.

To take advantage of scalable hardware architectures, CGL specifies support for
SMP and SMT, which includes process affinity, task exclusive binding to logical
CPUs and interrupt affinity capabilities. Large memory systems of more than 4GB
of physical memory are needed to handle the memory demands of scalable
communication applications.

Protocol stacks are required to be prioritized so certain protocols may take
scheduling priority over less important network protocols. To improve latency
and reduce CPU usage in network communications, zero-copy network protocols may
be needed. IPv6 forwarding tables are required to be compact and use a small
amount of memory. Support in the Linux Kernel for a 9000 byte Maximum Transfer
Unit (MTU) is required.

Performance Focus Areas
=======================

Real-Time Processing
--------------------

Scope
#####

The telecommunications application market faces new technical challenges with
the introduction of architectures such as Next Generation Networks and IP
multimedia services for mobile networks.

Real-time behavior is a major issue for new applications and protocol classes
based on IP services such as VoIP, SIGTRAN, and RTP, where real time behavior
drives the quality of service for end-users. Enhancements in real-time behavior
would allow Linux to be used for some applications that are currently run on
other real-time operating systems.

This document does not make a distinction between hard real-time and soft real-
time support in the Linux kernel. Real-time capabilities are defined in terms
such as maximum scheduling latency.

High Resolution Timers
######################

Incorporating high-resolution timers based on a 1 ms tick, rather than the
currently supported 10 ms tick, will enhance the real-time task scheduling
capabilities of Linux. If hardware platform support is provided for a 1 ms tick,
the kernel will no longer be required to program a specific timer to elapse
after 1 ms, eliminating overhead.

This feature enables:

   * A 1 ms quantum to be managed for task scheduling.

   * A 1 ms timer to be managed without requiring the kernel to program a
     specific clock. Configuring the kernel with a 1 ms tick value rather than
     the current 10 ms tick value allows rescheduling to occur every 1 ms in
     response to a periodic clock timer interrupt.

POSIX Real-Time Features
########################

POSIX real-time and advanced real-time features enable better support for real-
time, portable applications at the API level.

Protection Against Priority Inversion
#####################################

Priority inversion is an issue for real-time application programming because
scheduling priorities defined by design may be inverted causing unexpected
latencies. Priority inversion happens when a lower priority thread blocks a
higher priority one. The most general case is when a lower priority thread holds
a resource needed by the higher priority thread.

Priority inversion protection can be provided in the Linux kernel by dynamically
modifying the thread scheduling priority when lower priority threads are holding
resources.

Transitive priority inheritance is required to deal with cases where several
mutexes are used by several threads.

Scheduling policy can also be dynamically modified by the protection mechanism.
For example, time-sharing threads can be promoted to real-time FIFO threads.
This can have undesired consequences, however, as timesharing processes are
generally not coded with FIFO policy in mind. A means should be provided for the
client application to specify priority inheritance or priority protection
capabilities for the internal mutexes that they use.

APIs providing this capability should be implemented in such a way so that they
will perform correctly if they are promoted to real-time policies.

Message Queues with Priority Promotion
######################################

The priority inheritance protection mechanism can be extended by using a dynamic
priority promotion system for message queues. In such a system, the priority of
the receiver thread is promoted by the scheduler according to the message
priority, enabling processing of urgent messages with high scheduling priority.

Handling Interrupts as Kernel Threads
#####################################

Since interrupt service routines are not allowed to sleep, preemption locks in
interrupt handlers normally can‟t be changed to mutexes. To change preemption
locks that are placed in interrupt service routines, interrupt service routines
(aside from the timer interrupt routines) could be handled by kernel threads.

Mapping interrupt service routines onto real-time kernel threads enables
interrupt handlers to be assigned priorities and soft real-time processes to be
given higher priorities than interrupt handlers, allowing better designs. An
additional benefit is the reduction of critical sections in interrupt handlers.

Symmetric Multi-Processing
--------------------------

Reducing SMP Contention
#######################

Improving performance and scalability in an SMP system can be accomplished by
reducing resource contention through process affinity interrupt affinity, and
Hyper-Threading support.

SMP kernel critical sections can be handled by:

   * A spin-lock

   * A mutex, if not used in an interrupt handler

Generally, the spin-lock option is the faster in terms of CPU time, but it
requires that preemption be disabled and introduces processor-level latency when
the resource is already locked. The mutex option adds mutex and context
switching costs, but latency remains at the process level.

Using spin-lock with a high number of processors can lead to high latency
depending on the critical section length.

Quality of service must be taken into account for following cases:

   * When timers are armed in parallel on several processors

   * When concurrent file accesses occur

   * When shared-memory is accessed by several processors

Process Affinity
################

Process affinity provides for load balancing at the application level. When
process affinity is used, it provides more efficient caching. For example, it
must be possible to bind real-time processes to specified processors. Other
processes in the systems do not need to be assigned to specified processors.

Interrupt Handler Affinity
##########################

Assigning the top half of interrupt handlers to a single processor enables load
balancing of interrupt handlers. The bottom half and top half of each interrupt
handler should be assigned to the same CPU to reduce inter-processor contention.

Hyper-Threading Support
#######################

Because the logical Hyper-Threaded processors share a cache, the scheduler only
needs to keep threads attached to one of the adjacent logical processors.  The
scheduler can move threads between adjacent logical processors with no
performance degradation because the cache is stable between the two logical
processors.

Memory Usage
------------

As CPU capabilities increase, memory demands also increase as more communication
contexts can be handled per system. Memory related requirements are oriented
toward high physical memory (HIGHMEM) and virtual memory.

Support of More Than 4G Physical Memory
#######################################

Support for more than 4G of physical memory is a requirement for 32-bit and 64-
bit processor architectures.

COMMUNICATION SERVICE
---------------------

Communication services have a major impact on performance of telecommunications
applications. Performance of Linux stacks should be evaluated as follows:

   * Message delivery latency and throughput

   * Resource usage including CPU and memory usage

   * Load balancing capability on an SMP system

IPV4, IPV6, MIPV6 Forwarding Tables Fast Access and Compact Memory
##################################################################

The speed at which packets can be routed is limited by the time it takes to
perform the forwarding table lookup for each packet.

When a basic lookup method is used, such as the BSD binary trie, the number of
nodes equal to the length of the address in bits is potentially traversed in the
forwarding table, generating an equivalent number of memory accesses. The
current Linux implementation is not highly scalable.

Methods faster than those currently available should be implemented to support
2000 routes updated per second and up to 500,000 routes with low lookup latency.
The tradeoff between memory and access latency should also be addressed.

See “Survey and taxonomy of IP address lookup algorithms “ at
http://mia.ece.uic.edu/~papers/Surveys/pdf00000.pdf .

CLUSTER COMMUNICATION SERVICE
#############################

A cluster benefits from a cluster specific communication service that addresses
specific issues such as latency, ordering, and recovery. A cluster communication
service can achieve better performance than a general communication service when
used in a cluster, because it has knowledge of the local topology, including the
cluster membership.

DIFFSERV Support
################

Support should be provided for Differentiated Services (RFCs 2474 and 2475) for
IPv4 to enable quality of service and traffic control.

Prioritized Protocol Processing
###############################

A prioritized protocol processing mechanism enables a high-priority process to
quickly obtain data from the network even if massive packets arrive for multiple
processes. It is based on a protocol priority assignment mechanism that allows a
higher scheduling priority to be given to the protocol with higher priority.

I/O and File Systems
--------------------

Network Storage Replication
###########################

A network storage replication service uses local network and device resources.
Performance depends on the local network and storage devices used.

A network storage replication service provides a lower performance level
compared to local storage access. The relative difference must be less than 30%
in terms of user throughput in normal conditions when mirrored devices are
synchronized.

Upon device resynchronization, the user throughput should not be reduced more
than 25% compared to normal conditions.

Availability and Initialization
-------------------------------

Application Pre-Loading
#######################

The CGL 2.0 requirement for application pre-loading should be extended to
enhance dynamic loading performance. Often, several seconds are spent in the
dynamic ELF loader for symbol relocation.

|  - Affinity and load-balancing in an SMP.  Context switching overhead        |

|    to execute quickly, and deferrable part. The thread based interrupt       |

Standards Requirements Definition
.................................

One goal of the CGL effort to achieve high reliability, availability, and
serviceability (RAS), and application portability is to leverage mature and
well- established industry standards that are common and relevant to the
carrier-grade environment and include them as part of the CGL requirements.

Open standards are important because they are freely available for anyone or any
organization to use and because open standards can evolve with wide community
feedback and validation. The CGL WG is actively working with recognized standard
bodies, such as the Linux Standard Base (LSB – a workgroup of the Linux
Foundation) and the Service Availability Forum (SA Forum). These organizations
are producing standards and specifications that address the RAS and application
portability gaps between Linux as it exists today and where it needs to be to
support highly available communications applications.

The first requirement in this section shows the CGL working group's desire to
work alongside recognized standards bodies::

   CGL specifies the need for compliance to the Linux Standard Base (LSB)
   version 3.0 to ensure a CGL 5.0 distribution will have the support for the
   same level of the application binary compatibility as is required by the LSB
   standard.

CGL 5.0 requires implementation of the latest interface specifications from the
SA Forum to provide a common set of standards and building blocks for high
availability architectures and platform management. The SA Forum provides
standards specifications that define interfaces for cluster-aware applications
(Application Interface Specification - AIS version B.01.01) and for platform
management applications (Hardware Platform Interface - HPI version B.01.01).
See the SA Forum site (www.saforum.org) for the B.01.01 versions of the AIS and
HPI specifications.

Continuing from previous versions of the CGL specifications, the CGL Standards
Definition adds more POSIX compliance requirements based on IEEE Std
1003.1-2001. These additional areas of POSIX compliance are intended to bridge
the application portability gaps as mainstream communications applications are
ported to Linux application environments.

A variety of other standards requirements are included in the CGL Standards
Definition to address the networking, communications, and platform needs of
carrier environments. Standards requirements such as Stream Control Transfer
Protocol (SCTP), Internet Protocols (Ipv4/IPv6), Mobile Internet Protocol
(MIPv6), Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Intelligent Platform
Management Interface (IPMI), IEEE 801.Q (virtual LAN), Diameter, Common
Information Model (CIM), Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI), and PCI Express, are included.

More open industry standards will become mature and recognized over time. The
CGL working group will evaluate them for consideration in future versions of the
CG requirements. The CGL working group believes that the adoption of open
standards in mainline Linux offerings will benefit application developers and
solution providers and will carry Linux to the next level of popularity in the
communications industry as well as the general Linux user community.

Security Requirements Definition
................................

The telecommunications environment is different from a general-purpose computing
environment. The most salient differences to consider in developing a CGL threat
model are:

   * CGL systems do not have many user accounts.

   * User accounts do not reflect individual users.

   * CGL systems are configured through custom user interfaces.

   * CGL systems are typically configured without shell access.

   * Administrators are trusted and competent.

The major threat to the telecommunications environment is, therefore,
unauthorized access to management and control interfaces by outsiders. These
outsiders can gain access by subverting the operating system or one of the
applications it is running.

A severe potential security threat arises when applications need to touch
multiple security planes. Many telecommunication services can be provisioned
remotely by the end-user.

Many ISPs that offer domain hosting allow customers to create new mailboxes or
route incoming calls to 5-digit work extensions to any telephone number in the
world with just a few clicks on a web page. Facilities like these create a new
set of risks:

   * Unauthorized rerouting of email and telephone calls by disgruntled
     associates or unscrupulous competitors.

   * Exploitation of vulnerabilities in software to “jump” from one security
     plane to another, which can lead to many types of risks.

Mitigating these risks will require some forethought such that users of these
systems are properly authenticated and authorized and that information traveling
between planes passes through narrowly defined interfaces that protect against
unauthorized access.

Security Design
===============

The security objectives and requirements in this document are aimed at analyzing
and mitigating threats and improving resiliency to attacks on CGL systems. The
requirements in this section attempt to implement security objectives for CGL
systems and are based on an intersection of assumptions about CGL systems:

   * Intended use

   * Environment

   * Security policies

   * Exposure to expected threats and vulnerabilities

The security requirements are firmly rooted in sound security practices. These
practices and terminology borrow heavily from [CSPP-OS03], an example Common
Criteria profile for common off the shelf (COTS) operating systems.

Given the environment described in the previous section, the significant threat
to carrier grade systems is unauthorized access to management and control
interfaces by intruders.

The CGL Security Requirements have been based upon the Common Criteria
Protection Profiles:

   * Identify the assumptions about CGL systems based upon their use and their
     environment.

   * Draft a set of security policies to which CGL systems shall adhere.

   * Identify common threats to which CGL systems are exposed.

   * Derive the set of functional objectives that CGL systems shall implement.

   * Derive a coherent set of requirements that address the functional
     objectives.

Design Objectives
-----------------

This section identifies the security objectives met by the requirements in this
specification. A more complete list from which these security objectives were
taken is found in section 10.7. A Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the system and
environment to which these objectives are applied.

The following table specifies the security objectives met by requirements listed
in section of this document.

+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| *Security Objective*   | *Description*                                 |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.DETECT-SOPHISTICATED | The environment must provide the ability to   |
|                        | detect sophisticated attacks and the results  |
|                        | of such attacks (e.g. corrupted system        |
|                        | state).                                       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ENTRY-NON-TECHNICAL  | The environment must provide sufficient       |
|                        | protection against non-technical attacks by   |
|                        | other than authenticated users.               |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.PHYSICAL             | Those responsible for the system must ensure  |
|                        | that those parts of the system critical to    |
|                        | security policy are protected from physical   |
|                        | attack that might compromise security.        |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ACCESS-TOE           | The system must provide public access and     |
|                        | access by authenticated users to those        |
|                        | resources and actions for which they have     |
|                        | been authorized.                              |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ACCOUNT-TOE          | The system must ensure, for actions under its |
|                        | control or knowledge, that all users can      |
|                        | subsequently be held accountable for their    |
|                        | security relevant actions. It is anticipated  |
|                        | that individual accountability might not be   |
|                        | achieved for some actions.                    |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.AUTHORIZE-TOE        | The system must provide the ability to        |
|                        | specify and manage user and system process    |
|                        | access rights to individual processing        |
|                        | resources and data elements under its         |
|                        | control, supporting the organization‟s        |
|                        | security policy for access control.           |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.BYPASS-TOE           | The system must prevent errant or             |
|                        | non-malicious, authorized software or users   |
|                        | from bypassing or circumventing security      |
|                        | policy enforcement. NOTE: This objective is   |
|                        | limited to "non-malicious" because CSPP-OS    |
|                        | controls are not expected to provide          |
|                        | sufficient mitigation for the greater         |
|                        | negative impact that "malicious" implies.     |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.DETECT-TOE           | The system must enable the detection of a     |
|                        | specified set of vulnerabilities.             |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ENTRY-TOE            | The system must prevent logical entry to      |
|                        | itself using unsophisticated technical        |
|                        | methods by persons without authority for such |
|                        | access.                                       |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.KNOWN-TOE            | The system must ensure that, for all actions  |
|                        | under its control and except for a            |
|                        | well-defined set of allowed actions, all      |
|                        | users are identified and authenticated before |
|                        | being granted access.                         |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.OBSERVE-TOE          | The system must ensure that its security      |
|                        | status is not misrepresented to the           |
|                        | administrator or user. This is a combination  |
|                        | of prevention and detection.                  |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.RESOURCES            | The system must protect itself from user or   |
|                        | system errors that result in shared resource  |
|                        | exhaustion.                                   |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.APPLICATION-TOOLS    | The system must provide a reasonable,         |
|                        | up-to-date set of security tools and          |
|                        | libraries for use by applications.            |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ACCESS-MALICIOUS     | System and environmental controls are         |
|                        | required to sufficiently mitigate the threat  |
|                        | of malicious actions by authenticated users.  |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.DETECT-SYSTEM        | The system, in conjunction with other         |
|                        | entities in the environment, must enable the  |
|                        | detection of system insecurities.             |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.NETWORK              | The system must be able to meet its security  |
|                        | objectives in a distributed environment.      |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.ENTRY-SOPHISTICATED  | The system and environment must sufficiently  |
|                        | mitigate the threat of an individual (other   |
|                        | than an authenticated user) gaining           |
|                        | unauthorized access via sophisticated,        |
|                        | technical attack.                             |
+------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| O.CONTAINMENT          | The system and environment must provide the   |
|                        | ability to contain the effect of a security   |
|                        | failure of an application to that             |
|                        | application.                                  |

The following table specifies the security objectives not met by requirements in
section of this document.

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| *Security Objective*   | *Rationale for not including in specification* |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.ACCESS-NON-TECHNICAL | The environment must provide sufficient        |
|                        | protection against non-technical attacks by    |
|                        | authenticated users for non-malicious          |
|                        | purposes.                                      |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.AVAILABLE-TOE        | The system must protect itself from            |
|                        | unsophisticated denial-of-service attacks.     |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.INFO-FLOW            | The environment must ensure that any           |
|                        | information flow control policies are          |
|                        | enforced between system components and at the  |
|                        | system external interfaces.                    |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.RECOVER-TOE,         | Fail-secure is not something that CGL can      |
| O.RECOVER-SYSTEM       | provide.                                       |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.COMPLY               | There are many regulations that might apply    |
|                        | to CGL. It is not the responsibility of this   |
|                        | specification to enumerate requirements to     |
|                        | conform to this myriad of regulations.         |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.DUE-CARE             | It is the responsibility of the                |
|                        | administrative personnel to properly secure    |
|                        | and maintain a system.                         |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.MANAGE               | It is the responsibility of administrative     |
|                        | personnel to properly secure and maintain a    |
|                        | system. This includes periodic audits of       |
|                        | system configuration (not log analysis).       |
|                        | However, no such software is being required    |
|                        | by CGL.                                        |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.OPERATE              | Mostly this is the responsibility of           |
|                        | administrative personnel.  Secure default      |
|                        | configuration settings will not be listed in   |
|                        | this specification.                            |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| O.DENIAL-SOPHISTICATED | CGL is not directly able to mitigate most      |
|                        | denial of service attacks, as mitigating them  |
|                        | would require redesign of protocols and        |
|                        | interfaces.                                    |

ITU-T Recommendation X.805 et. al.
==================================

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has published many standards
that are relevant to the security of telecommunications systems. The
specification defers to the ITU standards for telecommunications-specific
security requirements. The CGL Security Requirements Definition is limited to
issues relating to security of the underlying operating system.

The X.805 Security Framework
----------------------------

X.805 defines security in terms of two major concepts which are layers and
planes.

The three layers are:
   #. Infrastructure - security of routers, switches, servers, communication
         links, etc.

   #. Services - security of services offered to the customer, such as leased
         lines, e-mail, SMS.

   #. Application - security of customer applications using services.

The three planes are:
   #. Management - security of OAM&P

   #. Control - security of signaling, i.e. Session creation and modification

   #. End-user - security of end-user data flows

Layers and planes intersect, forming a 3 by 3 matrix. Orthogonal to this, X.805
defines eight security dimensions:

   * Privacy and data confidentiality

   * Authentication

   * Integrity

   * Non-repudiation

   * Access Control

   * Communication

   * Availability

These dimensions touch each of the cells of the layers/planes matrix.  For
brevity's sake, we refer to the definitions in [ITU03].

Many of the issues addressed by X.805 are not relevant to our analysis, because
they are outside the scope of an operating system.

Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------

All discussion of security revolves around risk. Risks are created when a
security vulnerability is combined with the threat of that vulnerability being
exploited. In the common buffer overflow attack scenario vulnerability (the lack
of input validation in the software) and a threat (the attacker using software
that exploit the vulnerability), creates the risk of a successful attack. The
risk can be mitigated in different ways. The vulnerability is removed by fixing
the software.  The vulnerability is also removed by preventing the attack.

Risks do not necessarily have to be mitigated in software, but that the
environment in which a system is embedded can also mitigate them. This is an
important point because it is nearly impossible to construct systems that are
invulnerable to attack.

All Software Contains Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------

All software contains vulnerabilities and it is impractical to find and remove
all of them in a system. Some methods for lowering the risks relating to
vulnerabilities are:

   * **Not exposing the system running the software to insecure networks.**
     This is practical for certain limited purposes, for instance controlling a
     power plant. In the CGL environment one could segregate network traffic
     from different security planes, which would eliminate the threat of
     intruders attacking software operating in the management and control plane.

   * **Overflow detection through the use of programming languages and
     development tools.** One example is the gcc compiler using the stack
     protection (previously known as ProPolice) extension. Most stack buffer
     overflows will result in the premature termination of a program. This
     termination transforms the risk of a successful buffer overflow attack into
     a denial of service attack.

   * **Limiting software privileges.** A common approach is the use of 'chroot'
     jails, a method of restricting a program's access to a very limited part of
     the file system. Another approach is the use of a security manager that
     decides whether an application is allowed to perform certain operations. A
     common example is the Java sandbox which prevents access of applets to most
     system resources.

   * **Restricting network access using a DMZ.** The application and the system
     running it may still be compromised, but the problem is somewhat contained.

The solution of many security problems will be a combination of the correct
application of OS facilities, and a correct design of the environment in which
the systems operate.

Applications Accessing Multiple Planes
--------------------------------------

A particular issue exists where applications need to access multiple security
planes. Many CGL services can be provisioned remotely by the end-user. Many ISPs
that offer domain hosting allow the creation of new mailboxes by the customer.
These facilities create new risks:

   * Unauthorized rerouting of e-mail and telephone calls by disgruntled
     employees or unscrupulous competitors.

   * Exploitation of vulnerabilities in software to 'jump' from one security
     plane to another.

Mitigating these risks requires forethought.

   * The users of these systems need to be properly authenticated and
     authorized.

   * Information traveling between planes should pass through narrowly defined
     interfaces that protect against unauthorized access to the control and
     management planes from the end-user plane. A security failure in an exposed
     part of the system should not result in failure of the system as a whole.

Facilities that limit information flow between planes are not commonly
available.  Possible approaches could be:

   * Running software on multiple hosts, with very limited connectivity between
     them.

   * Running multiple processes on the same host, using operating system
     facilities to contain each process in its own security domain.

Privilege Minimization and Fine-Grained Access Controls
-------------------------------------------------------

Unix-like systems such as Linux share a few common security facilities:

   * Discretionary access control using user IDs, group IDs, and file system
     privileges.

   * Restriction of processes to a portion of the filesystem.  Some Unix-like
     systems provide additional facilities which can be useful under certain
     circumstances, such as:

   * Access Control Lists: Some access control policies are difficult to
     implement with the classical Unix access control mechanism. ACLs provide a
     more powerful mechanism to describe access rules. The lack of users on
     typical carrier grade equipment makes ACLs not overly useful.

   * Role Based Access Control: Users of the system can be assigned 'roles'
     which grant privileges to resources. The role 'help desk' for example could
     include privileges to change passwords for non-administrative users.  RBAC
     is most useful if there are many instances of the role. This is not
     commonly the case for CGL systems.

To mitigate risks precipitated by software design or implementation errors, CGL
requires a much more fine-grained control over system privileges. The common way
to handle programs that need certain privileges is to give them full privileges
at start-up time and let the program drop all the privileges they don't need.
This causes a few problems. The privileges that need to be dropped are not
necessarily the same on all systems, and there becomes a proliferation of
privilege-manipulation code on the system. Tools that allow the designer or
administrator to start software with the minimal set of privileges is required.

Another issue is that Linux systems do not have a sufficiently fine-grained
privilege model. For example, it is impossible to restrict the use of a specific
IP address and/or port range to a limited number of processes. Ideally, it
should be possible to allow a specific process to bind to port 80 (WWW) on a
single interface. Multi-level security (MLS) implementations can be used to
prohibit processes from accessing network interfaces they do not need to access.

Criteria profile for COTS operating systems.

This section borrows from a published example Common Criteria protection
profile. According to [CSPP-OS03] the following threats do not have to be
addressed by the target of evaluation.  We believe that given some of the
intended uses of this document we do need to address these two threats where
possible.

According to [CSPP-OS03] the following set of threats does not have to be
addressed by the OS (TOE) alone. The environment should also play a role in
addressing these vulnerabilities:

Hardware Requirements Definition
................................

To stay competitive and profitable in the telecommunication industry, standards-
based, modular, commercial-off- the-shelf (COTS) hardware components are being
used along with open software, including operating systems, middleware, and
applications. A goal of the CGL working group is to promote the migration of the
telecommunication industry from the proprietary hardware platforms to COTS
hardware by insuring that the Linux environment provides adequate support for
these COTS platforms. The CGL Hardware Requirements Definition – Version 4.0
identifies a set of widely-used industry hardware platforms and defines the
support that is needed in the operating system for these platforms. The scope of
these hardware requirements applies to the Linux kernel, kernel interfaces (APIs
and libraries), system software, and tools.

This section specifies a set of generic requirements that are common across
platform types. It includes support for blade servers, for hardware management
interfaces, and for blade hot swap events. To address the need to manage highly
available carrier grade systems through hardware out-of-band mechanisms,
management capabilities such as those found in the Intelligent Platform
Management Interface (IPMI) are also described.

Carrier-grade systems require high performance and high throughput
interconnections within a system and between system nodes. Hardware-related
requirements, such as PCI Express support, and PCI Express Device Hot Plug, are
included. Other hardware related requirements such as a CPU throttle mechanism,
iSCSI Initiator Support”, and “iSCSI Target Discovery” are also specified.

Considering the diversity of hardware platforms used in a carrier grade
environment, the CGL Hardware Requirements Definition - Version 4.0 does not
define requirements for just one type of industry platform. Instead it defines
generic platform requirements and then provides an “Industry Platforms” section
to provide implementation guidelines for specific architectures. Examples of
such industry platforms include AdvancedTCA, BladeCenter, CompactPCI and rack
mount types of servers.
